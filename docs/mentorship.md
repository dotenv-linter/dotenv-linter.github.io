# ✌️ Mentorship

> `Dotenv-linter` is not just a linter for `.env` files — it is also a **contributor-friendly open-source project** with the purpose of helping others learn Rust using a simple, but useful tool 😊

> In addition to studying Rust, this project has another goal — to **promote love for open-source**, help you with the first steps in it and give an opportunity to contribute to the open-source project written in Rust ❤️

> We act [as a mentor](https://rustbeginners.github.io/awesome-rust-mentors) within this project and **help developers** follow the path of a novice contributor from start to the top 🤗
