# What's new in v3.1.0?

Here's an overview of the key changes included in this release.

### 1. Suggestion of changes üî•

Previously, [action-dotenv-linter](https://github.com/dotenv-linter/action-dotenv-linter) could only display linter warnings as comments or code annotations.

In the new version, [action-dotenv-linter](https://github.com/dotenv-linter/action-dotenv-linter) can immediately suggest changes.<br/>
Now you don't need to switch to the code editor every time to fix the `.env` files.

To enable this feature, just change the `reporter` to `github-code-suggestions`:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/dotenv.yml
name: dotenv
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  dotenv-linter:
    name: runner / dotenv-linter
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Run dotenv-linter with code suggestions
        uses: dotenv-linter/action-dotenv-linter@v2
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.github_token }}
          reporter: github-code-suggestions
```

### 2. Variable substitution üÜï

Most of the `dotenv` libraries support variable substitution, where you can reuse variable values in `.env` files:

```bash
# .env
BAR=VALUE
BAZ=$BAR
FOO=${BAR}
```

It seems to be nothing complicated, but even here you can make some mistakes:

```bash
# .env
BAZ=${BAR
FOO=$BAR}
```

Therefore, we have added a new `Substitution Key` check, which will allow you to find and fix such problems.

PR: [#414](https://github.com/dotenv-linter/dotenv-linter/pull/414) ([@de-sh](https://github.com/de-sh)), [#428](https://github.com/dotenv-linter/dotenv-linter/pull/428) ([@DDtKey](https://github.com/DDtKey))

### 3. Improving checks üëç

In the previous version, `dotenv-linter` did not take into account the presence of substitution variables in `.env` files:

```bash
# .env
FOO=VALUE
BAR="$FOO"
```

What caused the following warnings:

```bash
$ dotenv-linter 
Checking .env
.env:2 QuoteCharacter: The value has quote characters (', ")
.env:2 UnorderedKey: The BAR key should go before the FOO key

Found 2 problems
```

In the new version, we have fixed this and now `dotenv-linter` does not display any warnings when using substitution variables.

PR: [#401](https://github.com/dotenv-linter/dotenv-linter/pull/401) ([@Ru5ty0ne](https://github.com/Ru5ty0ne)), [#406](https://github.com/dotenv-linter/dotenv-linter/pull/406) ([@stygian-coffee](https://github.com/stygian-coffee)), [#418](https://github.com/dotenv-linter/dotenv-linter/pull/418) ([@JuanMarchetto](https://github.com/JuanMarchetto))

### 4. Checking backups üëå

Usually, before fixing the file, `dotenv-linter` creates a backup by appending a timestamp to the filename.

```bash
$ dotenv-linter fix
Fixing .env
Original file was backed up to: ".env_1623238316"

.env:2 UnorderedKey: The BAR key should go before the FOO key

All warnings are fixed. Total: 1
```

When the linter was restarted, such files were scanned again and backups were created for them:

```bash
$ dotenv-linter fix
Fixing .env
Fixing .env_1623238316
Original file was backed up to: ".env_1623238316_1623238541"

.env_1623238316:2 UnorderedKey: The BAR key should go before the FOO key

All warnings are fixed. Total: 1
```

Starting with the new version, all backup files are created with the `.bak` extension and are excluded from scanning.

### 5. Displaying messages üëÄ

We added message output when there are no files for checking, fixing or comparing:

```bash
$ dotenv-linter
Nothing to check

$ dotenv-linter fix
Nothing to fix

$ dotenv-linter compare .env1 .env2
Nothing to compare
```

PR: [#392](https://github.com/dotenv-linter/dotenv-linter/pull/392) ([@jodli](https://github.com/jodli)), [#394](https://github.com/dotenv-linter/dotenv-linter/pull/394) ([@mdycz](https://github.com/mdycz)), [#398](https://github.com/dotenv-linter/dotenv-linter/pull/398) ([@jakecorrenti](https://github.com/jakecorrenti))

These are all the key changes that are included in the new [v3.1.0](https://github.com/dotenv-linter/dotenv-linter/releases/tag/v3.1.0) release.<br/>
