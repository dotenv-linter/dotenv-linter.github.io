# What's new in v2.2.0 (latest)?

We have prepared for you an overview of the key changes that are included in this release.

### 1. Fixing warnings üî• 

Previously, `dotenv-linter` could only find problems in `.env` files:

```bash
$ dotenv-linter
.env:2 DuplicatedKey: The FOO key is duplicated
.env:3 UnorderedKey: The BAR key should go before the FOO key
```

Now, it can fix them right away with the new `--fix`/`-f` argument:

```bash
$ dotenv-linter --fix
Original file was backed up to: ".env_1601378896"

.env:2 DuplicatedKey: The FOO key is duplicated
.env:3 UnorderedKey: The BAR key should go before the FOO key

All warnings are fixed. Total: 2
```

### 2. Making a backup üí™ 

Fixing warnings in .env files is cool, but just in case `dotenv-linter` create a backup for each file.

But this can be disabled using the `--no-backup` argument:

```bash
$ dotenv-linter --fix --no-backup
.env:2 DuplicatedKey: The FOO key is duplicated
.env:3 UnorderedKey: The BAR key should go before the FOO key

All warnings are fixed. Total: 2
```

### 3. Support for control comments üïπ

Previously, checks could be disabled globally using the `--skip`/`-s` argument:

```bash
$ dotenv-linter --skip UnorderedKey EndingBlankLine
.env:2 DuplicatedKey: The FOO key is duplicated

Found 1 problem
```

Now, `dotenv-linter` supports control comments that allow you to turn off checks for both the entire file and a specific line:

```env
# .env
# At the beginning - it disables checks for the whole file
# dotenv-linter:off DuplicatedKey, EndingBlankLine

# dotenv-linter:off UnorderedKey (You can disable a check for only some lines)
FOO=BAR
BAR=FOO
# dotenv-linter:on UnorderedKey (And enable it again)
```

### 4. Displaying the total number of problems üëÄ

When checking several `.env` files, there was often not enough information about how many warnings were found in all files.

We have added this information:

```bash
$ dotenv-linter
.env:2 DuplicatedKey: The FOO key is duplicated
.env:3 UnorderedKey: The BAR key should go before the FOO key
.env.test:1 LeadingCharacter: Invalid leading character detected

Found 3 problems
```
 
We have also added the new argument `--quiet`/`-q` to disable this:

```bash
$ dotenv-linter --quiet
.env:2 DuplicatedKey: The FOO key is duplicated
.env:3 UnorderedKey: The BAR key should go before the FOO key
.env.test:1 LeadingCharacter: Invalid leading character detected
```

### 5. Installing the latest version from the repository üç∫

Added the ability to install the latest version from the repository via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
$ brew install --HEAD dotenv-linter/tap/dotenv-linter
```

These are all the key changes in the project that were included in the new v2.2.0 release.
